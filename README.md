# TellMeWhy

## Overview
The TellMeWhy project is dedicated to advancing machine understanding of causal relationships through answering "why" questions derived from short narratives. Utilizing advanced NLP techniques and large language models such as T5, GPT, and Gemini, this project aims to generate coherent, causally relevant answers.

## Objective
Our objective is to systematically evaluate and enhance the capabilities of language models to process and respond to "why" questions, utilizing both quantitative metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, semantic similarity) and qualitative evaluations (causal relevance, coherence).

## Dataset
This project leverages the TellMeWhy dataset, comprised of narratives paired with "why" questions designed to probe the causal reasoning capabilities of AI models.

## Technologies Used
- **Language Models:** T5, GPT, Gemini
- **Techniques:** LoRa-based fine-tuning, strategic prompt engineering
- **Metrics:** ROUGE, BLEU, Semantic Similarity

## Features
Evaluates multiple language models on their ability to answer causal questions.
Implements LoRa-based fine-tuning to enhance model performance.
Utilizes prompt engineering to improve the relevance and coherence of answe
